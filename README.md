# About Me:

Hey there 👋,

📚 I am currently doing my Masters in Artificial Intelligence at JKU in Linz, Austria. <br>
🤖 There I have chosen the elective track "Mechatronics - Robotics and Autonomous Systems" because I am fascinated by robotics and drones. <br>
🎓 Before my master's degree, I did a bachelor's degree in business information technology.<br>
